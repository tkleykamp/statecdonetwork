                    <p>The State CDO Network is a project housed within Georgetwon University's Beeck Center for Social Impact + Innovation. We connect the top level data leaders in state governments to share best practices and support states in replicating effective data strategies. By convening and communicating across states, we seek to understand not only what's working, but how and why.</p>
                    <p>We are a non partisan collaborative focused on supporting state efforts to leverage data responsibly to support informed and effective policy making and to improve the delivery of critical state services.</p>

                    <h3>Considering Creating a CDO in Your State?</h3>
                    <p>Data is a strategic asset. If it were missing or unavailable, it would severely limit the ability of government to function. Additionally, data has the ability to help government to deliver the types of services expected by the public, to create more effective policy and to operate more efficiently. This is why state governments benefit from having chief data officers. Looking for a model CDO job description, or just a better understanding of what a CDO can do for your state? Weâ€™re here to support states in establishing a CDO role. Contact us to get started with your CDO position.</p>
